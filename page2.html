        <p>I have been self-employed as a Registered Massage Therapist for over a decade.
            I do enjoy my current profession but it is physically demanding and I am looking
            for a career change into the tech field. That being said, I do want to continue
            my work as an RMT part time, and I am happy being self-employed.
            So whatever direction I go in, I will likely choose to work for myself or try to find freelance work, unless 
            I find a company that aligns with my values and offers a good deal of autonomy.</p>
